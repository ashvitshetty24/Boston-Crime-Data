Our aim for the project is to prepare a data visualization representing the Crime Rates in Boston.
This dataset contains data from year 2015 to 2018. With this project we aim at assisting the local police departments who are often called upon to prevent crime and keep order. It is impossible to be present everywhere at the same time. Hence this visualization which aims to represent information about where the crimes take place, what are the major types of crime that take place in Boston and much more would ease their job. Thus, providing the local authorities with more guidance on where and how they need to deploy their forces to reduce the crimes.
Dataset and Software:
The dataset that we are using for our project is Crimes in Boston containing records from the new crime
incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident 
as well as when and where it occurred. The given dataset is generated and provided by the Boston Police
Department.

We have downloaded this dataset which is a csv file from Kaggle datasets. 
The dataset from Kaggle is not clean and contains many null or blank values. 
Our first step towards the project is to clean and prepare the dataset in order to achieve valid numbers
 and visualizations. Currently we have started with the process of data cleaning. 

The dataset fields provide information about the incident number, what kind of offense it was, what offense group it falls under, description of the offense, where did the offense take place (includes granular location details), when and at what time the offense took place.

The granularity of the data will help us to visualize maximum crime scenarios and help in providing a very 
robust visualization.
